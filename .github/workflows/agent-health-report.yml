            Generate a weekly health report on Claude's activity and effectiveness.

            Use GitHub CLI to gather data from the past 7 days:
            - `gh pr list --state all --search "author:app/claude"` for PRs Claude created
            - `gh run list --limit 50` for workflow run history
            - Count PRs opened, merged, closed-without-merge
            - Calculate merge rate (merged / total PRs)
            - Group PRs by risk label (auto-merge, needs-review, blocked)
            - Check for any workflow runs that failed
            - Calculate average time from PR open to merge (for merged PRs only)

            If there was NO Claude activity in the past 7 days, respond with "No activity" and do nothing else.

            If there WAS activity, create a GitHub issue with the title "Agent Health Report — week of [today's date YYYY-MM-DD]" and add the label "agent-health-report" (create the label if it doesn't exist).

            The issue body should contain these sections:

            ## Summary Stats
            - Total PRs created
            - PRs merged
            - PRs closed without merge
            - Merge rate (percentage)
            - Average time to merge (in hours or days)

            ## PRs by Risk Label
            - auto-merge: X PRs
            - needs-review: X PRs
            - blocked: X PRs
            - unlabeled: X PRs

            ## Failed Workflow Runs
            List any workflow runs that failed in the past 7 days, with links.

            ## Recommendations
            Based on the data, provide 2-3 bullet points with actionable recommendations. Examples:
            - If merge rate is low, suggest reviewing blocked PRs
            - If many PRs lack risk labels, suggest updating CLAUDE.md
            - If workflows are failing, suggest investigating common causes

            Keep the report concise and scannable.
